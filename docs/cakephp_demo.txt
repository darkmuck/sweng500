Basics of CakePHP:
1. Understanding MVC (Model View Controller) http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Beginning-With-CakePHP/Understanding-Model-View-Controller.html
   a. Model - represents the application data (serves as ORM (object-relational mapping) to database and provides an extra layer that can act as an intermediary providing data validation, sanitization, etc.)
   b. View - renders the presentation of the model data. This is what the user sees
   c. Controller - handles and routes requests made by the client (from the views basically)
2. CakePHP Structure: http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Basic-Principles-of-CakePHP/CakePHP-Structure.html
3. A typical CakePHP request: http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Basic-Principles-of-CakePHP/A-Typical-CakePHP-Request.html
4. CakePHP Folder layout/structure: http://book.cakephp.org/1.3/en/The-Manual/Basic-Principles-of-CakePHP/CakePHP-Folder-Structure.html

          /app     (our application code)
              /config
              /controllers
              /models
              /views
              /webroot    (this is the folder that the HTTP server should point to)
          /cake    (this is the cakephp library)
          /plugins
          /vendors
          .htaccess
          index.php
